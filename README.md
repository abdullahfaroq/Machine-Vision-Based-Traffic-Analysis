# Machine-Vision-Based-Traffic-Analysis
This MATLAB project uses machine vision to analyze road traffic videos. The system processes video files to detect and track moving vehicles, outputting video frames with bounding boxes around each detected vehicle.

Key Features
Automatic Video Loading: Streamlines the video processing workflow.
Noise Removal: Uses Gaussian filtering for cleaner frames.
Grayscale Conversion: Simplifies image analysis.
Car Segmentation: Identifies and isolates vehicles in frames.
Statistical Analysis: Extracts traffic metrics (number of vehicles, mean size, total area).
Bounding Boxes: Visualizes detected vehicles.
Applications
Traffic Management: Improves monitoring and control.
Surveillance: Automates vehicle detection and tracking.
Urban Planning: Provides data-driven insights for infrastructure.
Security and Emergency Response: Aids in traffic analysis during critical situations.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
MATLAB installed on your computer.
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Vision-Based-Traffic-Analysis.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
bash
Copy code
cd vision-based-traffic-road-analysis
Usage
Upload a Video:

Place your video file in the project directory.
Rename the video file to input_video.mp4 (or update the script with your video file name).
Run the MATLAB Script:

Open MATLAB.
Run the main.m script.
matlab
Copy code
main
View the Output:

The processed video frames with bounding boxes around moving vehicles will be saved in the output directory.
